# Sales and Inventory System

The INVENTORY system allows you to register PRODUCTS which are classified with CATEGORIES and SUB-CATEGORIES. In the purchase or sale processes, the products in the stock will be added or subtracted.

Each SALE process can be viewed in detail in the REPORTS modules, which allow filtering by date and status ranges the invoices found.
